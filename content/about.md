title: "About"

I am a software engineer based in sunny Portland, Oregon. I really enjoy collaborating with teams to solve difficult problems. I enjoy working across the stack but particularly enjoy infrastructure, tooling, databases and automation. In my spare time, I enjoy working on projects that align with my values and stretch my abilities.

When not building things indoors, I spend a lot of time outside - camping, running, hiking and biking. In particular, I love being a part of the Pacific Northwest trail running community and enjoy exploring the many trails located in Oregon and Washington.
