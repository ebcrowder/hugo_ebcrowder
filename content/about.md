I am a web developer based in sunny Portland, Oregon. As a developer, I really enjoy collaborating with teams to solve difficult problems. In my spare time, I enjoy working on projects that align with my values and stretch my abilities.

When not building things indoors, I spend a lot of time running in gorgeous Forest Park. I love being a part of the trail running community here in the Pacific Northwest and enjoy exploring the many trails located in Oregon and Washington. I also really enjoy cycling, hiking and camping.

Feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:ebcrowder@gmail.com) for coffee!
